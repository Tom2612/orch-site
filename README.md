# Find open music groups and play with them

This is a website I am creating as a full portfolio piece.
This is being created using MERN stack, RESTful API principles, and full CRUD.

## The idea

The idea is very simple - music groups (such as orchestras) regularly need seats and gaps filled for concerts. I want to connect orchestras to players who are willing to give up their time because they are passionate about playing music.

Groups will be able to advertise openings for pieces/instruments and players will be able to search/filter for specific pieces/instruments. The groups have an option of providing some payment (e.g. travel costs) for the players.

## The technology

As mentioned, this is a MERN full stack application that I will be working on continuously and regularly. Most days I am able to contribute a little something to it.

As of early Feb, the 'group' side of things is almost fully working in terms of being able to create groups, add concerts, update concerts, delete concerts, and players should be able to see all concerts posted. I am close to beginning the process of adding authentication so that groups can signup/login and access only their concerts.
